KNOWN BUGS:
1. Closing the project and reopening causes preview audio to not play.
2. Adding audio longer than video will cause the preview audio to behave unpredictably.  Video export will still work.
3. Using files with the same filename will cause all files with that name to use the audio of the last added file of that name.
